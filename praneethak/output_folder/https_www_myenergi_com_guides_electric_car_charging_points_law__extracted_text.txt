home  guides  electric car charging points law changes to uk compulsory charge points on new home developments as part of the uk governments road to zero strategy  which sets out a comprehensive package of support to reach our mission for all new cars and vans to be effectively zero emission by 2030 the government has announced that all new buildings both residential and nonresidential are fitted with an electric vehicle chargepoint the legislation for this navigated its way through house of commons in october 2021  and will come into effect on 15 june 2022  amazing news for the sector and new homeowners why have these changes been introduced as the popularity of electric vehicles continues to grow  representing more than oneinten of all new car sales  and government plans to ban the sale of new diesel and petrol cars by 2030 there is an increasing need to support the transition to electric providing easier cheaper and more convenient electric vehicle charging at home not only do new homes need to be ev ready but chargers will need to be smart too these new changes have been introduced alongside the governments recently published regulations on electric vehicle smart charging introduced earlier this year the new regulations state that in order for an electric vehicle charger to be smart it must now also have several smart functions that consider the integration with future technologies and relieves pressure from the electricity grid this level of functionality is something which myenergi has led the market on since the launch of the zappi in 2017 and a position we have championed as a required minimumstandard throughout these consultations  so we are really happy to see the uk governments commitment upping these minimum standards throughout the industry building regulations for electric vehicle charging points for developers the changes have been implemented into building regulations 2010 a summary of the proposed changes are for residential buildings  every new home with an associated car parking space will need an electric vehicle chargepoint this also applies to buildings undergoing a change of use to a residential building in addition any residential building under major renovation with more than 10 parking spaces should have at least one ev chargepoint and cable routes in every parking space for nonresidential buildings  every new nonresidential building and nonresidential building under major renovation with more than 10 car parking spaces will need to have at least one electric vehicle chargepoint and cable routes for every oneinfive spaces existing nonresidential buildings  every existing nonresidential building with more than 20 car parking spaces will need at least one chargepoint applicable from 2025 do the uk electric car charging points law changes affect homebuyers purchasing a home equipped with an electric vehicle chargepoint makes the transition to an electric vehicle easier and cheaper without having to worry about the upfront cost of an electric vehicle chargepoint which in turn means when looking to buy your next car all you need to do is pick which car is right for you to further support individuals transition to an electric vehicle you can download the new governmentbacked ev8 switch app the app allows you to track your journeys to work out how much you could save by switching to an electric vehicle see which ev would be the most suitable for you as well as the environmental benefits and more how myenergi can provide futureproof solutions for electric vehicle ready homes one of the biggest challenges developers may face is knowing which electric vehicle chargepoint provider to use and be able to easily identify the futureproof solutions that will add significant value after all the last thing homeowners need is the pressure to swap an outdated and incompatible charging device less than a few years after purchasing their new property whilst the introduction of making homes both ev ready and chargers smart takes down a barrier in the transition to electric and we feel that this is just one step towards carbon neutrality with looming targets on accelerating the uptake of heat pumps and falling costs of technologies such as vehicle to grid home battery storage or solar panels technologies which can cater to and control a widerange of home energy devices have never been more important thats why myenergi products such as the zappi have always had much more than simply charging your car in mind our intelligent ecosystem can serve multiple homeenergy devices
