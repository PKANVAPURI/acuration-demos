can an electric car go how far can an electric car go from full charge vehicle range is the estimated distance that your vehicle can travel on a single charge in terms of electric vehicles this refers to the amount of charge left in the vehicle battery at any given time this is often displayed on a vehicle dashboard as either a percentage or mileskm remaining a vehicles actual range depends on many fluctuating factors such as the environment and your personal driving and charging habits what factors affect vehicle range  your vehicles battery size measured in kws kilowatts  the more kws the battery holds the further the vehicle will travel on a single charge ie youd expect around double the range from a 60kwh battery when compared to a 30kwh battery  vehicle weight and design will affect the amount of kws used ie heavier vehicles will use more power than lighter vehicles this includes any extra weight added to the vehicle including equipment passengers and suitcases  driving style and habits will affect the amount of extra kilowatts used for example frequent stop  start driving through a town or city andor driving on more demanding terrain such as up steep hills will all put extra strain on the vehicle battery  environment weather  temperature will affect the amount of extra kilowatts used for example frequent stop  start driving through a town or city andor driving on more demanding terrain such as up steep hills will all put extra strain on the vehicle battery equally everchanging weather conditions will play their part in how the vehicle range is affected on a given day for example travelling headwinds would cause the vehicle to use more energy and conditions which affect the vehicles traction such as rain and snow will also play a part also when the temperature drops cold batteries need to use more energy to maintain their optimal operating temperature  other factors include  tire pressure how well maintained the vehicle and battery health are kept overall charging habits ie try to use lower voltage home chargers as part of your routine as opposed to high voltage rapid public chargers vehicles modes  some vehicles offer certain modes which sap more battery use of internal features such as heaters air con radio and electric windows aerodynamic lag  caused by windows being down suspension settings etc see some of these factors in more detail including how much it costs to charge an electric vehicle here how far can an electric car go the average distance an ev can travel is around 211 miles on a full charge vehicle range is determined by numerous factors including the size of the battery in kwh the vehicles weight  design and ever fluctuating factors such as the weather  temperature it is also dependent on the type of journeys you make for example driver a could drive more on motorways at a constant speed whereas driver b is an inner city driver which is more variable and stop  start manufacturers tend to advertise their vehicles with the maximum potential range in perfect driving conditions although it is now common practice for vehicle manufacturers to give different figures for both motorway and inner city driving range however the most accurate estimate for vehicle range is called an epa range sometimes referred to as actual range or real range which gives a more accurate representation of mixed driving conditions both inner city motorway and real world conditions how low can my electric vehicle battery go before it needs charging most evs convert kwh into a simple percentage figure to help determine the amount of charge left to sustain the longevity of a vehicle battery it is recommended that you maintain a minimum charge of at least 1520 however with the ever increasing number of public charge points now available and with the average distance between charge points decreasing it is more likely you would be able to make it to a charge point in the event your battery does become low though its worth noting that youd expect to get on average around 105 miles per 5 of charge therefore we certainly wouldnt recommend you risk entering a 20mile stretch of motorway if your battery level is in single digits your top range and kwh questions  answered how many kwh does an ev use per mile since we know that an ev uses around 025kw per km based on an average 54kwh battery and an average vehicle range of 211 miles we can conclude that an electric car will travel about 4 miles per 1 kwh used in the perfect driving conditions our handy table of ev maths to answer excluding factors and conditions average miles per kws  4 miles average kws per miles  025 kws 025 kws x 4 miles  1kwh average 211 miles  4 miles  5275 kws 300 miles  4 miles  75kwh battery 75kwh battery  300 miles  025kw per mile which electric car has the longest range 620 miles is the official range of the tesla roadster and currently in the top spot for the longest driving range for an electric car whilst the average between the top 10 longest range vehicles is 342 miles 0800 323 558 apacsalesmyenergicom products products zappi eddi harvi legal legal privacy policy returns policy terms and conditions new
