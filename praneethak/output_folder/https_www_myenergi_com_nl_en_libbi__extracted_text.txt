of sun and wind for example does libbi work with a flexible electricity tariff yes customers with a flexible or dynamic tariff for example in the netherlands nieuwe stroom anwb energyzero tibber frank can recharge and optimize their libbi around cheaper price periods libbi offers customers the option of charging exclusively through their solar panels or combined through solar and the grid this means you can get the most out of selfgenerated electricity while also charging at cheaper offpeak rates on average how long does it take to install libbi the average battery installation usually takes less than 1 day if you are having a battery installed in conjunction with solar panels it may take longer typically up to 2 days depending on the complexity of the work required for example this time frame does not include setting up scaffolding for a new solar panel where can i get libbi installed the libbi battery and inverter can be installed either indoors or outdoors however the libbi controller must be installed indoors when installed indoors there must be sufficient space around the system to allow airflow and it usually cannot be installed in attics due to weight or because an entry or exit route will be blocked our certified installation partners will guide you through their initial research for the best location for your libbi what is the largest system size i can buy the libbi system is modular it allows you to create a battery storage system from 5 kwh 1 battery to 20 kwh 4 batteries how do i determine what system size i need to optimize my solar power the size of libbi system best suited for your home will be determined by one of our certified installation partners this calculation is based on the size and electricity needs of your home plus the size of your existing solar panel system on average a typical household consumes between 8kwh and 10kwh of electricity per day using these factors our installers can ensure you have enough capacity in your libbi to store excess solar energy you have generated or your cheaper grid energy i have a source for wind power generation is libbi still compatible yes libbi can store excess electricity generated by independent wind turbines installed in the home upon detecting excess electricity libbi ensures that it is stored for future use or used to power your other devices such as zappi and eddi based on your charging preferences i have a threephase house connection can i use a libbi yes libbi can be installed on 1 phase of your 3 phase home connection with the possibility of installing up to 3 libbi systems 1 on each phase alternatively we will launch a version with a 3 phase inverter in due course so keep an eye on our website does libbi provide backup power during power outages the libbi system can be installed with optional blackout backup this means that in the event of a power failure libbi will supply the stored electricity to a special circuit or outlet connected to the libbi backup
