stay warm while putting the heating on is often a necessity in winter make sure you are properly insulating your home before doing so the last thing you want is to be wasting energy and money heating your home only for most of the warmth to escape through draughts and lack of insulation next time you feel the urge to crank up the boiler check that your house is fully draughtproofed another thing you ought to consider is the age of your boiler if your current tank is more than 15 years old its worth thinking of a replacement as older models can be significantly more wasteful are you currently using solar or wind power in your property we strongly recommend exploring the capabilities of eddi our stateoftheart energysaving device which diverts surplus power from such sources and uses it to
