register now most common faqs about zappi do i need solar panels for a zappi to work no not at all zappi works as a stand alone 7kw charger though has extra features not available on many other chargers that make it compatible with renewable energy systems such as solar panels and wind turbines what are the installation requirements for the zappi circuit breaker or 30ma type a rcbo depending on local installation requirements 32a curve b please note that a higher rated mcbrcbo may be needed due to thermal derating factors as recommended by the mcbrcbo manufacturer how many cts are provided  1 x ct for the 1ph version  3 x cts for the 3ph version how does the pen conductor loss detection works in case of a pen fault zappi becomes completely isolated from the input supply that means that all conductors present at the output socket or cable  including protective earth and control signals  will be safe removing any risk of potential electric shock zappi meets the requirements of bs 76712018 72241141 v what is the minimum charging level on the 3phase zappi in all cases the ev is the limiting factor some evs cannot be charged using 3phase hence they will only be charged using 1phase the charging current is limited by the ev as well usually its 16a 30a or 32a if your ev can be charged using 3phase zappi has the capability to charge at a low rate using only 1phase 1phase charging range  14 kw  07 kw 3phase charging range  41 kw  22 kw can i charge at different current rate across the phases in 3ph charging no when charging with 3phase the current drawn by the ev will be the same on all phases can the new 3phase zappi be connected to one phase only  yes it will act like a standard single phase zappi however only 1 ct input will be available can i swap an existing 7kw charger with the zappi  yes with the single phase zappi the supply is very similar just make sure you connect the extra ct sensors can i have my existing charger and a zappi installed together without overloading my supply it really depends on your installation setup you can install zappi using a dedicated circuit from your main consumer unit and set a grid limit to make sure you will not blow your main fuse or you can install your zappi from a secondary consumer unit a garage feed for example and connect a sensor to act like a group limit to make sure that your secondary supply will not be overloaded as an addition to the grid limit but dont forget to ask your dno if you are allowed to install a second charge point can you switch between 3ph and 1ph charging a 3ph zappi connected to a 3ph supply can be set to charge in eco mode using 1 phase only its quite useful when you want to charge at a lower rate to track surplus in eco mode but have the possibility to charge at 22kw in fast mode or by using the boost function can we charge a single phase capable ev with a 3ph zappi yes absolutely does the zappi support vehicle to grid v2g no how does eco and eco mode work when charging 3ph in all cases charging 3ph means taking the same power from all phases usually the electricity meter net all phases so does zappi you can than have import on one phase and export on another the total sum being zero zappi will make sure that the netting across phases equals 0 what can i measure with the cts on the 3ph zappi on a 3ph zappi the cts are supposed to be connected on a 3ph load grid generation battery etc you cant connect different types of cts they have to be installed on the same location it is different on the 1ph version of zappi that can measure 3 differents single phase loads grid gen and battery for example which evs can charge using 3ph the renault zoé the tesla range the bmw i3 the bclass electric though vehicle technology is improving
