and the journey to earth a passion project she describes as the perfect little gift for your ecowarrior children the future saviours of our gorgeous planet the solution  renewable energy the coronavirus lockdown has caused the demand for electricity to decrease resulting in renewable energy overtaking fossil fuels in powering britain the lockdown could well have sparked more peoples

energy sources grew by 150 180 more people asked google how does solar energy work while 160 more searches for advantage of solar energy were conducted wind turbine for home searches increased by 150 what does sustainable mean searches increased by 110 searches for types of renewable energy grew by 90 interest in electric cars grows car manufacturing in april slowed by almost 100 yet evs actually gained market share accounting for 17 of sales across the eu it would appear that interest in evs is growing potentially as a result of a shift in commuter habits and employment behaviour in fact searches for electric car home charging stations  something we at myenergi have perfected with zappi our ecofriendly smart ev charger  increased by 60 in the height of the covid19 lockdown what does all of this mean the hard work to stop global warming is only just beginning and the true test of the uks resolve to combat climate change is now as we emerge from lockdown and life returns ever so gradually back to normality there have already been reports of a surge in carbon emissions it is up to us as individuals and as a species to protect our planet to stop using fossil fuels to educate people families businesses leaders and the next generation and to start heavily reducing our carbon footprint its encouraging to see more people taking an active interest in the climate crisis and we can only hope that by offering even more ecofriendly products and guides on sustainability we can continue asking the questions that need to be asked and providing the answers people seek share story
