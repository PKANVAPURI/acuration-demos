 blog  our founders story theres only one ride that interests me  the incredible thrill ride of taking over the world jordan brompton cmo and cofounder of myenergi explains how a conversation between her and lee sutton ceo and cofounder of myenergi a renewable energy technology company led to becoming no 9 in the sunday times 100 as one of the worlds fastestgrowing renewable energy technology companies its sometimes easy to forget where it all started and just how far weve come after all if you told lee and i when we founded the business in 2016 that wed have employed our 400th team member launched our fourth product shipped our 400000th unit and opened subsidiaries all over the world in just a few short years wed probably have just laughed indeed looking back to the early days of soldering products by hand and shipping them from the local post office our journey really does seem unbelievable yet thanks to passion persistence dedication and a real determination to leave the planet in a better place than how we found it myenergi is fast becoming a household brand known the world over for technology innovation engineering excellence and  most of all  a commitment to leading the renewable energy industry our products are helping thousands of users to embrace energy independence reduce reliance on mains supply and minimise their environmental impact through the use of renewable energy cofounder and cmo of myenergi renewable energy technology firm jordan brompton with cofounder and ceo of myenergi lee sutton but this isnt about us the continued global rise of myenergi is down to each and every team member supplier investor and supporter that has joined us for the journey without you lee and i would still be sat at square one dreaming up new ways  as pinky and the brain our alter egos would say  to try to take over the world weve loved every second  and we think our journey has only just begun but while we can look back on the past few years with fondness setting up a business from scratch hasnt been an easy ride there have been ups and downs tears and tribulations setbacks and sleepless nights supply chain woes and unexpected curveballs noone could have predicted occasionally we saw the light at the end of the tunnel at other times it felt like the weight of the world was on our shoulders but through it all weve remained focused on our dream a dream of changing the world one day at a time ever wondered how it all came about take a seat grab a coffee and read on a moment of madness rather than a fairytale story dreamt up in a shiny glass citycentre skyscraper the idea behind myenergi came from a conversation over a bottle of wine in lees living room he couldnt understand why there wasnt a product on the market that allowed him to charge his ev from the solar pv panels installed on his house was it possible was it practical were there hundreds of zeroemission motorists out there all feeling the same way rather than undertaking years of market research and spending millions of dollars on focus groups we just went on google we couldnt find any competitor products that were using renewable energy past the end of page two so had the madcap idea of teaming up to solve the problem  based on nothing more than gut feel alone a talented electrical engineer lee had previously run a number of successful renewable energy tech companies he had the skillset to create the product while i had the sustainability network and marketing experience to build the brand it seemed the perfect partnership and we set out on a journey to take the renewable energy sector by storm cofounders of myenergi lee sutton and jordan brompton but rather than smooth sailing founding such a specialist startup business was a rude awakening having started with nothing except for our life savings finances were tight really tight the first product prototype took almost a year to develop and by this point the money had all but run out to keep our dream alive we ran a crowdfunding round online we needed 40000 to keep afloat but raised just 10000 it was heartbreaking a few people seemed to like the idea but most didnt believe in the mass market appeal after all it was mostly just early adopters driving first generation evs in 2016 more importantly it didnt seem that anyone was interested in installing their own renewable energy source such as solar panels seeing as the feedin tariff had been cut a few years previously had we rushed into things and risked it all on a moment of madness we werent sure evs were uncool renewables were unpopular  looking back starting the business simply didnt add up by this point the future seemed pretty bleak we were out of money and we were running out of time we believed in what we were trying to achieve but needed a miracle to take things to the next level to make matters worse my marketing budget was zero and there didnt seem a simple way to get the brand out there to the mass market i was reaching out to old contacts on linkedin in the hope of making something anything happen a truly unforgettable trip the turning point came when one of our first customers and industry friends jonathan porterfield contacted me about a trade event taking place on the orkney islands tv personality robert llewellyn who was really into renewable energy and had just started a small channel on youtube  fully charged was going to be there and it seemed the perfect opportunity to get some feedback on what wed spent so long creating first generation zappi we both decided this would be a great opportunity and that i should attend we agreed that i should take his first generation nissan leaf it set the tone of what we were trying to achieve  i couldnt turn up in a dirty diesel we wanted to really live our brand so i set out on what turned out to be the most important but most challenging trip of my life leaving the office i felt like i was embarking on an adventure with enticing dreams of what exciting opportunities were to come instead i ran out of charge twice after all the uks ev infrastructure was in its early days from lincolnshire the first public location i could charge at was so far away that i had to roll in on 0 battery obviously the charger wasnt working i spent hours on the phone to try and get it fixed as well as to find alternatives but by this point i was so late that id missed my ferry myenergi cofounder and cmo jordan brompton with fully chargeds robert lewellyn by this point i just wanted to go home but pressed on and managed to get on the next crossing to orkney it just so happened that robert llewellyn himself was on that ferry who was the first to console a fellow budding ev entrepreneur having gone through the journey from hell we spoke for the whole crossing and got on famously after the trade show finished he asked if he could film a behind the scenes episode on the zappi and  from that day on  the phone began to ring ditching the christmas party early we were growing organically but progress was slow we were still soldering by hand in our countryside office and sending out zappi units at the local post office we needed a significant capital injection to take things to the next level and so set about building a network of possible investors thanks to growing interest our entrepreneurial spirit and the impact of fully charged we started to catch the attention of the finance community a few of these funds wanted to buy our business for a pittance but some really saw the longterm potential experienced financiers sir terry leahy and bill currie were two of the latter and we were invited to their liverpool offices to pitch our case myenergi cofounders lee sutton and jordan brompton with experienced financiers bill currie and sir terry leahy the email came through when lee and i were halfway through our christmas party so we left early having already enjoyed a festive fizz or two to work on our presentation our business was growing and i knew we had a chance to share our dream but neither of us had much experience with sourcing investment or best practice business fundraising we drove to liverpool with our business plan in hand rapping and planning all the way perfecting our pitch and psyching ourselves up our lack of experience in this sort of raise meant we low balled ourselves by only asking for 150k looking back it wouldnt have touched the sides sir terry and bill were both blown away by our story so far and were committed to putting the money in they just asked us to go away and be more ambitious with our ask we came back and gave the pitch of our lives right there on the spot we were offered the investment  it felt like dragons den i remember walking out of the office getting into the lift the doors closing then literally jumping and dancing with excitement wed raised 18m it was truly a careerdefining moment id never seen that kind of money before in my life it was miles away from the small startup business wed been developing i realised almost immediately that what we were doing wasnt just a clever idea but a business opportunity that had the legs to go global its such an important memory and i remember absolutely every detail from what i was wearing and the smell of the room to how i was feeling and the colour of the walls the feeling was indescribable
