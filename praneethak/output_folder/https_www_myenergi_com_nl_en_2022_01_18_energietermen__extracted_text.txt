develops as quickly as green energy it is difficult to keep up with the latest jargon its easy to get lost in all the terminology reason for us to help you out by listing 25 green energy terms and their meanings green energy terms our mission is to inspire and educate as many people as possible about the possibilities in saving our planet a big part of that is explaining the basics and why we do it you will come across the following green energy terms on a regular basis wed love to explain what they mean climate change terms climate change means a significant change in temperature and weather conditions that deviates from the norm it is one of the greatest crises facing humanity it includes more than just global warming it also refers to all the changes that are happening on our planet terms you may come across are co2 footprint this term describes the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere as a result of the behaviour of individuals organisations or communities global warming this english term indicates that the overall temperature of the earths atmosphere is rising it is thought to be caused by the greenhouse effect which in turn is caused by increasing amounts of carbon dioxide chlorofluorocarbons and other pollutants in the atmosphere chlorofluorocarbons cfcs chlorofluorocarbons are a group of chemicals consisting of chlorine fluorine carbon and hydrogen in 1970 it was discovered that these substances caused a chemical reaction that is destroying the ozone layer and strongly contributing to global warming they were found in refrigerators and spray bottles and were widely used until the early 2000s since then these substances have been banned ozone layer the ozone layer is part of the earths atmosphere and forms a barrier over the planet it helps to block harmful radiation from the sun greenhouse effect the greenhouse effect refers to the heat of the sun that is trapped in the atmosphere this occurs when the suns rays reach the atmosphere but cannot be reflected back the rays are absorbed by the greenhouse gases greenhouse gases greenhouse gases are all gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect by absorbing the suns rays the best known greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons fossil fuels fossil fuels are formed from the remains of dead organisms over millions of years they are nonrenewable and finite this means that they cannot be replaced when they run out renewable energy terms renewable energy includes all renewable energy that comes from natural sources such as wind sun water and geothermal heat it includes biomass hydroelectricity solar energy and heat geothermal energy and wind energy biomass biomass is a broad umbrella term for all organic substances such as agricultural crops organic waste manure and wood or woodchips geothermal energy geothermal energy also known as geothermal heat is energy gained by using the heat from steam or hot water reservoirs to drive an electric generator hydropower hydropower refers to the electricity generated by flowing water solar energy solar energy is energy that is generated by the rays of the sun solar panels are often used for this purpose tidal energy tidal power makes use of the differences between low and high tide the energy of the moving water is used in a turbine to generate electricity wave energy wave energy makes use of the rapidly changing water heights at sea the waves it is therefore very similar to tidal energy wind energy wind energy makes use of the power of the wind the wind currents set the blades of a wind turbine in motion and thus create electricity smart meter a smart meter keeps track of electricity consumption in your home and shows how much electricity you are using at the moment and how much it costs it also allows you to check your energy consumption remotely low co2 emissions low carbon means that you emit less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere with a particular technology solar energy storage a solar storage system ensures that the electricity you generate with your solar panels but do not use is not automatically fed back into the grid but is instead stored watt w watts is a unit of power and indicates how much energy is consumed for example your television may consume 80 to 400 watts per hour and a light bulb around 60 watts kilowatt hour kwh kilowatt hour means one thousand watts per hour it shows how much electricity is being consumed electric car or electric vehicle ev an electric car runs purely on electricity and uses an electric motor to propel itself these cars emit fewer greenhouse gases than petrol or diesel cars and do not use finite energy sources photovoltaic pv photovoltaic refers to the way sunlight is converted into energy hybrid car a hybrid car is a combination of an electric car and a petroldiesel car in one it is a more environmentally friendly alternative to petrol and diesel cars as they emit less greenhouse gas battery electric car or battery electric vehicles bev a battery electric car is a car that runs only on a battery they use no fuel or diesel and are 100 per cent electric plugin hybrid or plugin hybrid electric vehicle phev a plugin hybrid car is a car that uses the combination of an electric battery and a petrol or diesel engine the difference between a plugin hybrid car and a hybrid car is that the battery of a plugin hybrid car can be charged a hybrid car cannot be charged via an external charger and only charges while driving a plugin hybrid car often has a longer range than conventional hybrid cars myenergi energy terms our mission at myenergi is to create and innovate green energy products that help reduce your co2 emissions and energy bills zappi our smart ev charger
