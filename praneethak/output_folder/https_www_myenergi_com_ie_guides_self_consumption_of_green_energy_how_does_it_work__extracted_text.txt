selfconsumption of green energy how does it work home  guides  selfconsumption of green energy how does it work there is no denying that our world depends on electricity but how can we make sure that our reliance on it doesnt come at the cost of our planet by embracing selfconsumption and energy efficiency what is selfconsumption more often than not solar panels or solar photovoltaic technology and wind turbines will produce more than enough energy to keep your home fully powered this surplus energy gets sent back to the national grid  even if it exceeds your export tariff to counter this selfconsumption lets you keep all of the energy you produce therefore reducing your reliance on the grid and the amount of wasted power you send back to it with a selfconsumption system such as our innovative eddi device electricity will be diverted back into your house before it goes out to the national grid the benefits of selfconsumption the main benefit of using a selfconsumption system is that you will be almost entirely selfsufficient you wont need to send your electricity to the grid nor will you have to rely on it when power is no longer being produced due to nighttime or poor weather an additional benefit is that this means your bills will drop too without taking power from the grid you are no longer being charged for the electricity you already had but were unable to store selfconsumption is just the beginning while selfconsumption means you dont waste any of the green energy you are producing it is just as important to make sure that you are using your power efficiently energy efficiency is a natural step to helping improve our carbon footprint by utilising all of our generated power and saving it where possible we are creating less waste and lowering the demand for extra energy production from the grid  which could be coming from damaging sources such as fossil fuels what if i need to power an electric car our intelligent zappi electric car charger is
