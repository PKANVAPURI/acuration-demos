revolution home  blog  the new zappi launch  a revolution its been a busy yet exciting couple of weeks at myenergi last week we had the unveiling of our newest flagship product  the new zappi launch the event was hosted at millbank tower overlooking the thames and we were delighted to host some of the most influential people within the ev industry the stars of the show were the new zappi models the singlephase 7kw variant complete with its fresh makeover and the highlyanticipated threephase 22kw zappi both available as tethered and untethered units details about the new soon to be released myenergi hub device and app offering internet connectivity for remote control and live view of energy flow were also presented to highlight the advancements of our exciting product range as well as being able to perform as a regular charge point for customers who dont have solar or wind on their property these new exciting developments add significant value to our customers with gridtied microgeneration systems  particularly when maximising the benefits of the zappis three different charging modes the zappi maintains its ability to limit what grid supply it can take whilst looking to access any surplus green energy available ensuring it remains the most eco and customerfriendly charge point on the market one particular highlight from the launch that will be music to the ears for all the installers out there is that the new zappi complies with the bs7671 18th edition regulations which comes into force january 2019 and is currently the only charge point available where in most cases an earth rod is not required during the install  an installers dream sir terry leahy myenergi investor and former ceo of tesco offered words of wisdom and highlighted the positive steps being taken as we remain proud flagbearers at the forefront of the revolution and our friend at evergreen smart power andy mckay gave an exciting and insightful look into the future of green energy robert llewellyn the former red dwarf actor who now fronts the youtube channel fully charged was present to champion our cause and we had further support from fiona howarth of octopus energy who discussed the successful partnership they have with the myenergi team the reception and support on the day were incredibly wellreceived and humbling without the backing and unity of the whole myenergi team both those present at the launch and those back at base the unveiling of our new products at such an electrifying event would never have been possible cofounders lee sutton and jordan brompton would both like to thank the team and everyone involved who has helped myenergi achieve so much in such a short space of time the story so far of myenergi really is phenomenal  everything is done in house from the concept design and all the way through to the manufacturing of the final product on site in the village of binbrook lincolnshire we are confident that myenergi will continue to play a pivotal role in helping support the electric vehicle charging infrastructure and with the increasing uptake of the evs on the road worldwide we aim to expand exportation of our ecofriendly products to every corner
