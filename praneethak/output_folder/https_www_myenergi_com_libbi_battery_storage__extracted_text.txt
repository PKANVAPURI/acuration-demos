periods libbi offers customers the option to charge solely from solar pv or from solar and the electricity grid combined meaning you can make the most of selfgenerated electricity whilst also charging using cheaper offpeak tariff prices how long does it take to install libbi on average the average battery storage install is typically less than 1 day  if youre having a battery installed with a solar array this can take longer typically up to 2 days depending on the complexity of the work required  for example this timescale doesnt include erecting scaffolding for a new solar array where can i have libbi installed the libbi battery storage system and inverter can be installed both indoors and outdoors however the libbi controller must be installed indoors when installing indoors there needs to be sufficient space around the system to allow for air flow and it cant usually be installed in loft spaces due to the weight or blocking an entry or exit route our certified installation partners will walk you through the best location for your libbi during their initial survey what is the largest system size i can purchase the libbi system is modular by design with this you can create a battery storage system between 5kwh 1 battery up to 20kwh 4 batteries how do i work out what system size i need to optimise my solar the size of the libbi system best suited for your home will be worked out by one of our certified installation partners this calculation is based on the size and electricity requirements of your home plus your existing solar panel system size a typical uk household uses between 8kwh and 10kwh of electricity per day on average using these factors our installers can ensure you have enough capacity in your libbi to store excess solar electricity you have generated or your cheaper electricity grid energy i have a wind power generation source will libbi still be compatible yes libbi surplus electricity generation from independent wind turbines installed in the home when detecting surplus electricity libbi will ensure that this is either stored for future use or used to power your other devices such as zappi and eddi based on your charging preferences im on a 3 phase supply can i still have a libbi yes libbi can be installed on 1 phase of your 3 phase supply with the potential to install up to 3 1 on each phase alternatively we will be launching a 3 phase version in due course so watch this space will i still be eligible for my existing feed in tariff fit tariff if i install a libbi those who are receiving feedintariff payments for the electricity they generate with solar pv will need to inform their fit licensee in most cases the licensee is the electricity supplier who has been contracted to supply electricity to your home a qualified myenergi installer will provide guidance on how to do this does libbi provide backup power in the event of a power cut the libbi battery storage system can be installed with optional blackout backup this means that in the event of a power outage libbi will provide the electricity its stored to a dedicated circuit or socket thats connected to the libbi backup output 0333300 1303
