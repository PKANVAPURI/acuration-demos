own cable which is often supplied with the ev the main advantages with untethered chargers are    those with type 1 vehicles would require a special type 1 to type 2 cable so would tend to opt for an untethered unit  if you required a custom length cable eg needed a 12m cable between the charger and the vehicle tethered units come with a 65m cable attached  they are aesthetically neater subject to opinion tethered chargers tethered chargers come with a cable attached to the unit which cannot be detached the cable has a type 2 plug attached which has become the worldwide industry standard and is suitable for all modern evs excluding a handful of early type 1 models hence if you have type 1 you should choose the untethered unit the main advantages with untethered chargers are    convenience is the biggest benefit for choosing a tethered unit negating the need to keep unpacking and packing away your detachable lead each time 7kw chargers 7kw chargers are the most common charger for a home charging station and would be the most suitable recommendation for existing residential properties and most new builds with a single phase supply 22kw chargers 22kw chargers are the most common charger for smaller commercial and workplace charging properties with a three phase supply however some modern homes especially new developments can opt for a 22kw charger if there is a three phase supply to the property what is fast car charging fast car chargers are ultimately ev chargers which charge at rates between 7kw  22kw ac the process simply involves putting more electricity into your cars battery at a faster rate where a typical 3 pin 13amp plug socket in the home would charge at the rate of 23kw fast chargers charge at more than three times the speed 22kw in comparison charge at more than nine times the speed  23kw 3 pin plug socket known as granny charging  would take around 24 hours on average to fully charge from 0  100 dependent on vehicle  note most hybrids have very
