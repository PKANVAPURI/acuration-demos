charging at home  all things ev home  guides  the ultimate guide electric car charging at home  all things ev electric car charging at home  all things ev in december 2020 the uk government announced a ban on the sales of petrol and diesel vehicles from 2030 in favour of electric vehicles which dont emit carbon into the atmosphere this is a welcome move for planet earth and mankind as a whole understandably there will be questions and plenty of them therefore we have decided to research and provide better answers to as many of your top 50 questions as we could in our ultimate guide to charging electric cars at home and everywhere in between our research consisted of firstly creating a number of averages based on forty of the best selling evs on the market in 20202021 lots of the information available online tends to focus on one particular vehicle battery size notably 60kwh which although is a common battery size it doesnt necessarily match the average battery size across a wide array of vehicles weve concluded the current average to be closer to 54kwh this is especially true when you factor in vehicles such as the popular tesla model 3 which sits at the higher end of the battery scale boasting a 75kwh battery option or alternatively the smart eq fortwo city car which has a smaller 175kwh battery the size of your vehicles battery is key to answering questions based on vehicle range and how long your vehicle takes to charge vehicle weight also plays a part as a general rule the larger the battery size in kwh the further the vehicle will travel on a single charge however larger batteries will usually take longer to become fully charged and are often heavier think of this like filling a 5 litre bucket of water against filling a water 1 litre bottle of water it will obviously take longer to fill the 5l bucket but you have 5 time the amount of water available however it will also be heavier what is an ev an ev is an abbreviation for electric vehicle ev was a term adopted by the automotive industries to describe a car that runs on lithium ion batteries electric cars are fuelled by electricity which is stored in the cars internal rechargeable battery the battery powers an electric motor which then turns the wheels when the pedal is engaged batteries have a storage capacity measured in kwh batteries use on average 025kwh per mile and need recharging regularly the benefits of electric cars are endless as well as a cleaner and safer environment better air quality and an overall move towards a greener future they are also cheaper to run less hassle to maintain quieter and are driving companies to begin inventing innovating and designing thus creating a whole new economic sector how much does an ev cost the average cost to fully charge an electric car from empty to full is 777 the average monthly cost to charge an ev is 3108 based on fully charging your ev once per week evs are also exempt from paying road tax ev owners can save an average of 5748 per month on fuel savings alone which is a total average saving of 68976 per year also electric vehicles dont require oil  filter changes which cost an average of 100 electric cars are cheaper to maintain because there are significantly less mechanical moving parts that are susceptible to wear and tear an oil  filter change is no longer required there are no hidden costs to owning an electric vehicle the costs involved are as similarly clear to owning any other vehicle you could argue the initial outlay is slightly higher due to the investment into a brandnew technology and elements such as the extra costs considered to install a charging point though the long term savings for owning an electric car and home charging point far outweigh the initial outlay and you will soon see a return on your investment where can i charge my ev the easiest and most efficient place to charge your vehicle is at home using your own charging station such as the zappi eco charger however if you are running low whilst out on the road there are over 12000 public charge points available throughout the uk with more being listed daily charging infrastructure is growing rapidly especially since the announcement to ban the sale of fossil fuel cars from 2030 charging your electric vehicle at home is the easiest and most cost effective way to charge most ev owners will top up their charge their vehicles over night ready for the morning charging a vehicle every night will cost around 111 to maintain full charge and 777 to fully charge from empty it is not a necessity to charge your electric vehicle every night though one of the many beauties of owning a domestic charge point is your ability to do just that which in turn saves you time money and with less reliance on public chargers not all electric vehicle chargers are the same though most modern evs come with type 2 sockets which are compatible across all the variations of charger for example home chargers tend to be ac and charge at the rate of 7kwh public chargers are usually dc and charge at faster rates there are also 22kwh chargers available though not all vehicles can charge at these higher rates how long does it take to charge an electric car battery the time it takes to charge an electric car battery is dependent on the speed of the charger typically a public charger would take around 60 minutes to achieve a full charge whereas a typical 7kwh home charger would take around 7hrs 42 minutes many companies across the uk are offering free electric charging points as an incentive for customers to use their services in the same way companies offer free parking like parking there will likely to be time limits involved and a requirement to purchase or use the services rapid chargers draw direct current dc at rates which are considerably faster than an average domestic charger which draws accelerating current ac ac is converted to dc before it hits the vehicle which slows down the overall process whereas dc bypasses the conversion process hence faster charging speeds a granny charger type 1 is ultimately your cars spare charger which allows you to charge your ev with any standard 3 pin socket though as the name suggests it charges at a far slower speed of 12kwh 10amps compared to the usual 7kwh via an average home charging point how much does it cost to charge an electric vehicle at home the cost of charging an electric vehicle in the united kingdom is dependent on numerous factors including the specification of the vehicle size of the battery and how the car is driven the cost also differs between domestic charging and public charging the price per kwh of electricity differs throughout the uk however the average price per kwh sits at around 1440p the average sized battery across forty of the best selling evs is 54kwh the average cost of a full charge at home is 777 which equates to an average of around 211 miles of range the effectivity of charging your vehicle every night or once a week is fairly relative in terms of end result on average we use 7kwh of battery per day therefore its the difference between charging at home for 30 minutes to 1 hour per day or 710 hours in one charge dependent on battery size how do people with no driveway charge their electric cars there is lots of dialogue currently between the government and the ev industry surrounding electric vehicle owners without driveways if you have a car park or allotted parking bay it is possible to have a charger located if you rent the building or land your tenant may have to think about ev infrastructure and regulations going forward we recommend both renters and tenants keep an eye on the gov website for updates to ev regulations other current options are to use public chargers workplace chargers or sharing schemes it may also be worth contacting your local authority regarding infrastructure plans within your area schemes such as the orsc are available in some areas the best way to have an electric charging point installed is to call a certified olev approved installer who will ensure your ev charger is installed to the highest recognised safety standards in doing so you can then claim the 350 olev grant towards both the charger and the installation more about vehicle range  the frequency of charging how far can an electric car go the average distance an ev can travel is 211 miles however this is dependent on numerous factors including the size of the battery in kwh the vehicles weight  design and everfluctuating factors such as the weather what happens when an electric car runs out of battery if you have never run out of petrol when driving it is unlikely you will run out of battery the concept of recharging is the same as refilling your vehicle wed recommend heading to the nearest charging station when your vehicle reaches between 1520 capacity recharge on a public dc charger will take between 1030 minutes dependent on your vehicles charging rates how many kwh does an ev use in the perfect conditions an electric vehicle ev will use on average around 025 kwh per mile though this figure will fluctuate slightly based on changes in rolling resistance temperature wind direction and daily weather conditions how low can my electric vehicle battery go before it needs charging to maintain the longevity of a vehicle battery it is recommended that you maintain a minimum charge of at least 1520 the average distance between charge points in the uk is 61 miles meaning the bare minimum charge required would be 4 though this is not recommended what is the longest range on an electric car 620 miles is the official range of the tesla roadster and currently in the top spot for the longest range on an electric car the average between the top 10 longest range vehicles is 342 miles what is the range of an ev 211 miles is the average range of an ev when comparing 40 of the best selling electric vehicles in 2020 range is determined by many factors including vehicle weight and the kwh size of the battery how much does electric car charging at home cost it would cost 777 on average to fully charge an electric vehicle at home and most users would fully charge once per week this is an average of 3108 per month why are electric vehicles better for the environment are evs better for the environment evs are much better for the environment the movement towards electric vehicles will play a giant part in the worlds quest towards carbon neutral electric vehicles produce zero carbon emissions whereas the average combustion engine releases between 8000  10000 grams of co2 per gallon how green is an electric car electric cars use lithiumion batteries with zero carbon emissions therefore electric cars are certainly greener than cars which burn fossil fuels and release carbon into the atmosphere arguments made against the transition to electric vehicles often have vested business interests in fossil fuels or heavy pollutant industries do electric cars give off emissions electric cars dont give off emissions directly the positive changes in air quality during covid 19 lockdown periods is living proof of just how much carbon is released into the atmosphere on a daily basis through fossil fuel vehicles indirect emissions may be produced during the manufacturing processes and through the generation of electricity though switching to electric vehicles will drastically lower overall carbon emissions and improve air quality will power stations and the grid be able to cope in our ev future the introduction of time of use tariffs in particular will encourage ev drivers to charge their vehicles during off peak periods when demand on the grid is lower ev drivers can expect prices often as low as 003  005p per kwh during less demanding periods equally expect higher rates during busier periods more about vehicle batteries  how long should an electric cars battery last 15 years an electric car battery will last anywhere between 8  22 years dependent on numerous factors including weather conditions charging habits and how the car is driven most manufacturers offer a 5  8 year warranty on their batteries a common question amongst ev newbies and early adopters alike conditioning an ev battery by maintaining a charge between 20  80 is becoming a popular practice amongst electric vehicle owners this helps to prolong the batteries health and longevity by keeping the ions in a steady state of charge and elongating load cycles how long can an electric car sit without charging if you are leaving your electric car for a lengthy period of time without driving it the car battery will discharge anywhere between 14 050 to 3 kw a day dependent on the cars mode and particular power sapping features some of these features could be turned off to prevent higher rates of discharge though wed recommend referring to the owners manual for your particular vehicle equally some vehicles go into sleep mode the ions in a battery dont like to remain in a state of being under charged or equally overcharged therefore keep a steady medium and decrease the charging range to between 20  80 leaving 20 headroom either side opposed to charging from 0 to 100 full cycle 20 becomes the new 0 and 80 becomes the new 100 can you over charge an electric vehicle it is not possible to overcharge a vehicle battery the charge process will cut off when the battery is at full capacity if there are uncommon cases where batteries have overcharged it is possibly due to either a fault with the battery andor failed vehicle components relating to charge regulation regenerative braking more commonly known as regen in the electric vehicle industry is the transfer of kinetic energy to chemical energy which is stored in the vehicle battery this energy can then be used to drive the vehicle almost all batteries can be recycled particularly lithium ion batteries which are found in electric vehicles mobile phones and many other rechargeable devices maintaining an ev are electric cars more reliable electric cars are considered more reliable electric cars tend to score more highly in the reliability categories across numerous customer surveys which is not surprising as there is less that can go wrong in a battery powered vehicle the most common fault in electric vehicles is with the battery itself which is very easy to replace and usually under warranty with the vehicle manufacturer do electric cars break down less electric cars brake down less often than those with internal combustion engines due to the fewer mechanic moving parts involved as well as being less prone to oil leakage and blockages battery power is a simpler process and far cleaner do electric cars need oil fully electric cars do not need motor oil motor oil is used to lubricate the moving parts of an internal combustion engine for which electric vehicles dont have instead electric vehicles are powered by a rechargeable lithium ion battery do electric cars need servicing electric cars need servicing annually just like any other passenger vehicle brakes windscreen wipers seat belts and vehicle safety features still need servicing however savings can be made on oil changes filters and combustion engine faults which are no longer required do electric cars need an mot electric cars still need an mot annually after 3 years from new there is a slight variation in the testing stage in that evs dont require an emissions test are electric cars manual or automatic electric cars are automatic in terms of the similarities in driver experience when compared with a manual vehicle ie no clutch or gearstick however when comparing an automatic combustion vehicle and an ev the technologies are entirely different drivers will likely notice the difference in acceleration speeds when driving an ev and the quietness of the motor do electric cars need a gear box electric cars dont need a gearbox clutch or gear stick because they dont have mechanical gears electric vehicles only have one gear the average rpm range of an electric motor is 20000 rotations per minute opposed to an average of 7000 in a fuel combustion engine financial incentives  grants do you have to pay road tax on an ev as a vehicle owner and road user you must still register this vehicle either on of off the road however road tax is charged based on carbon emissions and as electric vehicles emit zero carbon evs cost 000 in road tax what is the electric car grant there are numerous grants available through the uk government for people and companies opting to switch to electric vehicles the average driver in the uk can save 3000 on a new ev and 350 on a home charging point ozev grant ended on 1st april 2022 do i have to pay congestion charges currently both electric and hybrid vehicles are exempt from paying inner city congestion charges however from october 2021 only fully electric vehicles with zero emissions will be exempt from these charges 0333300 1303 salesmyenergicom myenergi pioneer business park faraday way stallingborough grimsby dn41 8ff opens in a new tab services services our story contact news
