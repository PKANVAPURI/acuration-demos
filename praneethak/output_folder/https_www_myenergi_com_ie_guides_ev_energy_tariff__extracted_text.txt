drivers can benefit from an ev energy tariff home  guides  how ev drivers can benefit from an ev energy tariff what is an ev energy tariff an ev energy tariff is a type of electricity pricing plan designed specifically for electric vehicle owners these tariffs often offer lower rates for charging evs during offpeak hours usually at night when the demand for electricity is lower the aim of such tariffs is to encourage ev charging when the grid is less stressed and to make electric vehicle operation more economical for owners each utility company may offer different ev energy tariffs with variations in rates and charging times so its advisable to explore the options available in your specific location why switch to an ev energy tariff in a recent advisory the aa highlighted the importance of exploring different electricity tariffs to maximise value for electric vehicle owners the organisations research indicates that ev drivers could potentially pay up to 35 times more on some tariffs compared to others this could result in an additional yearly expense of over 1000 for some users buy zappi saving potential to illustrate this we are using irelands topselling ev the volkswagen id4 and some of electric irelands rates as examples if an id4 owner were to use electric irelands payasyougo tariff at 043 per kilowatt hour it would cost approximately 3332 to charge the vehicles 77kwh battery fully although this figure might seem economical compared to petrol or diesel costs its significantly more than what an ev driver could be paying with a more suitable plan with average annual mileage in ireland being 17000km this tariff could add an extra 1381 to domestic electricity bills by using smart or dayandnight electricity meters users could benefit from electric irelands night rates at 0215 per kilowatt hour this reduces the cost of charging an id4 battery to about 1659 translating to an annual cost of 688 this is significantly cheaper than the 2300 yearly petrol costs the advantage of night boost further savings can be made with electric irelands night boost tariff charging users only 0126 per kilowatt hour between 24am although it might not fully charge an empty battery in the limited twohour window it could add around 80km of range for just 190 this should provide sufficient range for many drivers reducing the yearly cost to as low as 404 as per our findings an average irish driver covering about 17000km per year could save up to 1000 annually by choosing the right charging time and tariff if they can make do with an 80km range topup every night the annual cost could be just 40400 said blake boland of aa ireland alternative ev tariffs while electric irelands night boost tariff is indeed competitive it is not the only option there are more flexible and costeffective tariffs on the market that offer savings over a longer duration for instance energias electric car energy plan charges only 0103 per kilowatt hour from 11pm to 8am
