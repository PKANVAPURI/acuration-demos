every year in the uk its estimated that the equivalent of 40000 early deaths can be linked to breathing in polluted air according to british lung foundation meanwhile it is also reported that 248 hospitals are in areas where air pollution is above the world health organisations limit not only are fossil fuels and global warming damaging our wildlife and environment they are also having a seriously detrimental effect on our health renewable energy sources such as wind power solar panels and hydroelectric energy on the other hand are much more natural and therefore ensure cleaner air 3 energy in abundance it is widely reported that the amount of energy we can pull from coal is finite while nuclear energy is detrimental to the state of our planet renewable energy is a whole different story though as the name suggests renewable energy produces a vast supply of power with the earths resources able to consistently top up the tank in fact solar wind biomass and hydroelectric power is already generating half of germanys output while costa rica recently went 300 days on renewable energy 4 cheaper to run while the initial installation of renewable energy sources can be significant the truth of the matter is that in the long run it will save you money its important to see the likes of wind turbines and solar panels as an investment the moment you start consuming your own energy  which is effectively endless and recyclable  you will soon see more disposable income in your bank account at the end of each month 5 more control over your own energy fed up of paying for power from the grid why not selfconsume your own supply and gain control of your electricity our green products in particular our eddi energy diverter enable you to reduce your reliance on the national grid and
