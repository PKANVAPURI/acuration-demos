grid whether youre an electric vehicle owner planning to buy one or just techcurious this blog post will equip you with insights into this transformative technology lets plug in and get started car charging a brief history while we believe that electric cars are a modernday invention they actually date back to the early 1830s while at this time they were not massproduced the technology still existed they were mostly workshop vehicles built for personal use and were very limited to range and speed the lower cost of the combustion engine soon took charge and took the spotlight away from any potential of running cars from electricity for a long time it is only really since 2006 that electric vehicle sales have soared this is due to the increase in reliability range and advances in technology most leading car manufacturers now produce at least one electricfirst vehicle and with every advancement the price of electric cars is also coming down electric cars are forecast to reach price parity with petrol cars by 2025 not all electric vehicle chargers are the same though almost all modern electric cars come with type 2 sockets which are compatible across all the variations of charger this is with the exception of a handful of very early models which use a type 1 charger home chargers require an ac single phase supply which most irish homes have and charge at a rate of 7kwh public chargers known as rapid chargers are usually dc and charge at much faster rates between 50kwh  150kwh though usually for a higher cost public rapid chargers found at charging stations are also tens of thousands of pounds in comparison to commercial fast chargers or home chargers which are fraction of the price there are also 22kwh chargers available known as fast chargers for your home or workplace though the premises would require a 3 phase supply to charge at these faster rates these types of charger are often used on commercial premises equally not all vehicles can charge at these higher rates of ac so its worth checking if your vehicle can handle 22kwh charges that said you wouldnt do any damage plugging into a 22kwh charger instead your vehicle would simply revert to charging at the slower 7kwh rates if you do have a 3 phase supply wed recommend opting for a zappi 22kwh car charger to utilise faster charging rates though for most residential homes wed recommend opting for a zappi 7kwh charger what is a smart car charger a smart car charger works seamlessly and individually with your own electric car it allows you to manage how much energy to give to any pluggedin car
