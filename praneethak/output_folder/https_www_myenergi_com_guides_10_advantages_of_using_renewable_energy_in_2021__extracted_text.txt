energy in 2021 home  guides  10 advantages of using renewable energy in 2021 advantages of using renewable energy with the news constantly filled with horror stories about the escalating climate emergency it may seem obvious to many of us just how important the existence and the advantages of using renewable energy but with the turn of a new decade upon us its always important to reflect upon our values and to share our hopes for a brighter greener decade ahead to implement real and positive environmental change is an effort that starts in small steps from all of us to carry out our mission to make the world a kinder and more sustainable place raising awareness about the benefits of renewable energy is kind of our thing and what could be more educational than this handy guide of the advantages of renewable energy on a local national and global scale 1 itsrenewable renewable energy will never run out flowing water plant matter heat from the planets core sunny skies and strong winds are inexhaustible and provide an immense source of sustainable energy with the uk becoming increasingly less reliant on finite fossil fuels following our greenest year yet in 2019 the pledge to become carbon neutral by 2050 is becoming less of a hope and more of a reality not only the most popular but the most cost effective bigscale renewable energy source offshore and onshore wind farms have become the uks largest source of renewable electricity having flourished in recent years on our windy little island predictions show that wind power is going to become even cheaper as technological advances make turbines even more effective 2 lower maintenance requirements  less risk more profit which brings us nicely into our second point renewable energy is going to become even more cost effective green power already costs less to maintain than burning fossil fuels and while setting up a wind farm may seem expensive onshore wind farms and solar photovoltaic energy are cheaper to generate than gas and power stations there is also far less risk involved in generating renewable energy getting rid of combustible and highly flammable resources that rely on mechanised maintenance is a much safer alternative 3 renewable energy saves money long term unlike the inevitable skyrocketing prices of fossil fuels technological advances and increased environmental responsibility means that renewables will only get more affordable as they become more efficient as fossil fuels become increasingly scarce their demand will increase and their prices will reflect how finite they truly are making them a financially unsustainable option for any of us looking towards the future 4 the environmental benefits possibly the most important advantage of renewable energy is that it puts an end to the production of greenhouse gasses most notably the co2 that causes global heating with tabloids already making the transition from the term climate change to the term climate crisis the impact of burning fossil fuels since the industrial revolution has been catastrophic to our planet from the bushfires ravaging australia to the unprecedented speed in which the polar ice caps are melting we are being confronted almost daily with the dangerous effects of burning fossil fuels with the uk striving towards carbon neutrality by 2050 the measures to reduce carbon emissions are already being implemented  and are only set to become more pivotal as the decade progresses 5 less reliance on imported energy  stronger economy with the decline in north sea oil and gas production making the uk increasingly dependent on importing nonrenewable energy the transition to nationally produced renewable energy strengthens our economy and stabilises our energy market since 1998 the uk has gone from being a net exporter to a net importer of energy relying on countries such as norway and russia for our gas petroleum and crude oil this dependence makes us vulnerable to fluctuations in global demand meaning that we end up paying more for imported energy which also has its own carbon footprint and leaving us at the economic mercy of the countries that we import from 6 less fracking fracking or the process of drilling down into shale rock to retrieve gas and oil has become increasingly controversial stories of earthquakes frequently occuring in the uk near fracking sites heightened concern that the process was placing the surrounding communities in danger the government has since halted fracking in the uk until evidence can be found that it is safe however the process is yet to be banned permanently despite the huge amount of money it costs to achieve on a national level the transition to renewable energy makes the practice of fracking redundant and prevents any further risk to the surrounding local communities 7 improving public health its a well known fact that burning fossil fuels emits a lot of pollution into our atmosphere what is less frequently talked about is what happens when we as a population breathe and live in that pollution the longterm health risks of living in industrially polluted areas include breathing problems heart attacks neurological issues cancer and a multitude of other serious and potentially fatal complications by moving away from fossil fuels were not only looking after our planet  were looking after ourselves and our loved ones 8 building stronger communities but its not all doom and gloom emerging electricity tariffs are putting green energy at the heart of our communities  a trend that is only set to increase a deal made by coop energy will soon allow people to opt into receiving renewable energy from 90 local renewable energy generation projects all over the uk this movement towards communityled projects means that the providers get a fair price encouraging and investing in our local communities to build a greener future together 9 more jobs the renewable energy industry is labour intensive unlike the mechanised fossil fuels industry  therefore it fundamentally creates more jobs mechanised fossil fuel technologies may reap in the profits it saves from labour costs but by having a peopledriven workforce the renewables sector invests in its workforce and the creation of jobs the more labourintensive an industry happens to be the more jobs it creates 10 the ripple effect in addition to the jobs directly created through the renewable energy industry the growth will have a knockon or ripple effect upon the local businesses and industries in the surrounding areas this positive chain reaction will occur as industries in the renewable energy sector prosper which will increase household and business income and benefit all local economies if you would like further
