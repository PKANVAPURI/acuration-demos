to know the earth is a beautiful and powerful planet but it is also a planet in urgent need of saving fuel and pollution are slowly draining its power but we can save it by using renewable energy part of the solution is geothermal energy or geothermal heat it is a source of energy that literally comes from the earth we are happy to tell you more about it what is geothermal energy people have been enjoying geothermal energy for thousands of years if you have been on holiday to iceland switzerland or hungary you may have enjoyed it too how through hot springs of course these thermal baths use geothermal energy to heat the water but what is that exactly the word geothermal comes from ancient greece geo means earth and thermos means heat so it is literally geothermal energy how does geothermal energy work carbonfree sustainable and renewable geothermal energy ticks all the boxes to be a clean costeffective alternative to fossil fuels like coal oil and gas but how does it work as we told you earlier this energy source uses the heat generated by the earth itself according to scientists 999 of our planet is warmer than 100 degrees celsius so it is a huge source of energy during chemistry classes at school we learn that heat equals energy why because it creates a movement of atoms and molecules geothermal energy uses currents and hot springs within the earths crust for energy special geothermal heat pumps convert this heat into energy to heat and cool our homes what is a geothermal heat pump geothermal heat pumps are becoming increasingly popular these heat pumps absorb the heat in the ground and use this heat to heat your home they can also be used the other way around to cool your home different types of heat pumps there are generally two types of geothermal heat pumps on the basis of a horizontal capture network on the basis of a vertical capture network the first type of heat pump uses heat from the ground in your garden in your garden a network of tubes is dug up through which a fluid flows this fluid extracts the heat from the ground a heat pump based on a vertical capture network works basically the same way instead of using the ground in your garden wells are drilled with this type of heat pump this last type is mainly used when there is not enough ground surface available around your house other types of renewable energy our planet is so polluted by the use of fossil fuels that climate change is a serious threat to our society the good news is that there are plenty of alternatives to these fuels such as geothermal energy want to learn
