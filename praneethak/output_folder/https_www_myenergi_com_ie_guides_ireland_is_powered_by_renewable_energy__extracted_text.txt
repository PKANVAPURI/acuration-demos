ireland is powered by renewable energy home  guides  how much of ireland is powered by renewable energy throughout history we have utilised different energy sources which have had to become more advanced to meet our growing needs from early man who burnt wood to the industrial revolution which caused great clouds of smog from coal burning fortunately we have come a long way from rubbing sticks together for warmth or burning coal to power all of our machines now we have the choice to use more sustainable sources of energy like solar power how much of ireland is currently powered by renewable sources incredibly 421 of all of the energy generated in ireland came from renewable energy sources such as wind and solar farms whats more this was a rise from 333 in 2018 and the figure seems to be consistently rising although this data seems very encouraging in 2022 ireland saw a dip in the use of renewable energy with the demand for energy increasing gas alone generated 48 of the total electricity used in ireland for the year and 64 in august alone with demand for energy increasing each year and set to double by 2030 its time to take a bit of a closer look at how we can be less reliant on fossil fuels for the environmentally conscious things can seem bleak however we are starting to see a further shift towards renewable energy sources after all in 2015 only 9 of all of irelands energy usage why has our reliance on renewable energy increased it is likely that our growing awareness of the consequences of global warming and climate change is the main reason for this we are now more aware than ever of the damaging and lasting impact of fossil fuels on our planet with policy and decisionmakers influencers businesses and the general public all looking to decrease their carbon footprint people are consistently finding more and more reasons to install sustainable and renewable energy sources in their homes and businesses from reducing emissions to cutting down bills it is no coincidence that we are now seeing more of the following power generators solar panels wind turbines geothermal hydroelectric turbines what more can be done to increase our renewable energy usage and reduce emissions the solution is simple the more we replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources the healthier our planet will be to combat climate change we need to make the most of
