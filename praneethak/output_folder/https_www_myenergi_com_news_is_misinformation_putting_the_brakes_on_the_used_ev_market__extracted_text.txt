myenergi is misinformation putting the brakes on the used ev market home  blog  is misinformation putting the brakes on the used ev market according to insight from the society of motor manufacturers and traders smmt more than 30500 secondhand battery electric vehicles bevs changed hands in the second quarter of 2023 an 818 rise on the same period last year1 used plugin hybrids phevs also grew in popularity with sales up 11 in terms of availability a quick search on autotrader brings up more than 16500 results for used bevs and nearly 11000 results for used phevs spanning 47 manufacturers and hundreds of models  from hatchbacks and hybrids to coupes and convertibles the choice is truly vast and availability is immediate while you cant miss the mix of topend nearly new models pushing upwards of 100k theres also a huge choice of cars for far less than 179202  the average uk spend on a secondhand vehicle you might have to compromise a little when it comes to colour features or mileage but the listings are packed with brilliant buys the used ev market should be thriving  and such impressive growth figures suggest that progress is building fast however when you dig beneath the surface the reality is a little different indeed as a percentage of total used car sales plugin vehicles comprise less than 2 of transactions there seems a dichotomy between the growing opportunity and lacking consumer confidence but why well even though the choice is there many motorists are still put off by misinformation from battery systems failing and range figures plummeting to planned obsolescence after an initial threeyear finance deal is up weve all heard the rumours but whats the truth how long can you really keep an ev when will you need a new battery does the range start to drop quickly after purchase whats more with energy market volatility seeing electricity prices rocket do the risks really outweigh the benefits of ev over ice are used evs a ticking time bomb in short no while perceived battery life is still a concern for some motorists experts suggest that the average electric vehicle battery evb can last almost 20 years or 200000 miles  a significantly longer lifespan than the typical internal combustion engine and far longer than todays average length of vehicle ownership whats more while battery efficiency will eventually start to drop the average ev will lose just 2 of accessible range per year  an arguably minor decline it might sound obvious but the latest models have been designed to far outperform their petrol and diesel predecessors significant investment has been made by manufacturers into designing evermore capable vehicles to suit the needs of tomorrows drivers and it really shows the evs of today which include those on our list have excellent ranges impressive durability and are cheap to maintain thanks to fewer moving parts the antiev movement will tell you otherwise but electric vehicles arent designed to fall apart after a few years theyre not programmed to break to slow down to lose efficiency or to rack up costly servicing bills vehicle manufacturers are pioneering the future with cars that really are here to stay so while scaremongering is commonplace switching to electric really is the sensible option for motorists need a nippy runaround for your trips into town theres countless hatchbacks thatll suit you down to the ground need something a little bigger for motorway journeys you can pick up an suv saloon or estate thatll keep on going for another decade but what about the elephant in the room the volatile energy market and high electricity bills will your used ev quickly become a drain on your finances will the price cap rise far above falling petrol prices leaving me between a rock and a hard place all important questions but again motorists shouldnt be concerned while the environmental benefits of evs are widely publicised the financial benefits are equally as impressive at current prices a small hatchback would cost less than 650 per annum for the average driver to run if they charge at home even though these prices will increase when the energy price cap changes evs will still be the most costefficient option by far  especially with fuel prices pushing 150 per litre for diesel and an average tank 55 litres costing upwards of 80 the real cheat is if you have a solar array and an ecosmart home ev charger like the myenergi zappi in this instance you can effectively charge for free by selfconsuming your selfgenerated renewable energy  zero fossil fuels zero reliance on the grid zero emissions travel of course it requires an upfront investment but the ability to take total control of your home energy use is an attractive one so should you look to the used market for your next ev well absolutely  there really is something for everyone whats more with a huge selection and less than average demand youll likely grab a steal as we move evercloser towards 2030 however the used ev market must become a key part of the uks transition to electrification the laggards and selfprofessed petrolheads will continue to spread misinformation but the reality is really quite different from the current driver perception lets not allow rumours to slow the transition to electrification 1 secondhand electric vehicle sales soar to record levels  business news  sky news 2
