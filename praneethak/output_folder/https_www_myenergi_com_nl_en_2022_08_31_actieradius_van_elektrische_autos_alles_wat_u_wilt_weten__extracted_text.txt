electric cars everything you want to know when we talk about electric cars the range is often mentioned but what is that really and why is a range not always the same we are happy to tell you more about it what is a range the distance you can drive an electric car with a full battery is called range it is also called range or range it can be compared to the distance a fuel car can drive on one full tank for electric cars in the middle class the range is 310 kilometers on average to compare a fuel car in the middle class has an average tank of 45 liters with that you can drive about 630 kilometers why is a range not always the same the power of the battery also determines the range electric cars that have a battery with higher power will be able to cover a greater distance in addition the capacity of the battery may decrease as it gets older as with fuel cars the range of your car is further dependent on consumption and your driving style the weather can also play a role in colder temperatures your range will be lower power of your battery the capacity of your battery determines how much electricity you can store and is determined by the size of the battery in small cars there is often not much room for the battery so it can be smaller as a result large cars often have a higher range than smaller cars however more and more new technologies are being developed so that in the future it will probably be possible to put more energy into small batteries the range of small electric cars will therefore be higher in the future consumption while driving for gasoline cars consumption is expressed in the number of liters of fuel used per 100 kilometers because an electric car uses electricity its consumption is expressed in the number of kilowatthours of electricity used per 100 kilometers as with diesel and gasoline cars the larger the car the higher the consumption will be the influence of the weather on your range the battery of electric cars works best at temperatures between 15 and 25 degrees celsius at warmer temperatures the capacity of the battery decreases the battery can become warm due to the sun but also due to fast charging it is therefore important to cool the battery when fast charging however the battery is also not a fan of low temperatures it produces less energy which reduces your range you can sometimes drive up to 30 kilometers less especially when you drive long distances in cold temperatures for example when you go on winter vacation it is good to take this into account how can i maximize the use of my battery with a few tips you can increase your range for example drive 100 kmh on the highway instead of 120 kmh driving slowly will drain your battery less drive the same speed as much as possible and let the car roll out to brake the air conditioning and heating in your electric car consume a lot of energy this reduces your range dont overload your car if you dont need your roof box or bike rack its smart to leave it at home that way youll have less air resistance and your car wont have to work as hard check your tire pressure regularly inflate your tires preferably every two months properly inflated tires are not only safer but also use less energy and extend the life of the tire extra tip always take a charge card with you if the battery runs out sooner than you expected while driving you can recharge it en route share story related news see all articles more about myenergi myenergi receives a 30 million investment from energy impact partners to promote growth and internationalization
