you cant hardwire any or all of your cts back to zappi or eddi units harvi will transmit ct data wirelessly subject to distance and certain obstructions what does a red zappi eddi or harvi light on the hub indicate this indicates a loss of communication between the hub and whatever device is displaying the red led check that the hub has an ethernet cable connected to your router what distance can the wireless comms on the harvi or hub reach we usually recommend no more than around 2025m although in a lot of cases this can be much further each site needs to be assessed on an individual basis for anything that could obstruct or disturb radio communications can the ct cable be extended is there a max length yes you can extend them up to a maximum of 100m but you must use a twisted pair cable cat5 for it to work and maintain correct polarity throughout do i have to have a ct fitted to the solar pv feed or not providing the grid ct is fitted then zappieddi will work perfectly the solar pv ct isnt compulsory but it does give you your solar pv information on the zappieddi screen and also on the app giving you one place to view everything does the zappi require any rcd protection no the zappi 2 has an atype rcd with 6ma dc leakage protection built in meaning no requirement to fit an rcd elsewhere there are no histories showing in the app though real time data is fine please check the timedate settings are correct on every myenergi device on the timedate menu check the timezone is correct auto dst is turned on update from cloud is turned on if paired with a hub what does a red server led on the hub indicate a red server light means that the hub is not receiving any data from the server check that the hub has an ethernet cable to your router and that this cable is working ok by plugging in another device such as a computer you should also try rebooting your router and the hub which zappi do i need if my ev uses a type 1 connection if your ev uses the type 1
