diversity matter biological diversity is critical for the overall health of our planet biodiversity provides us with natural disease resistance climate change migration oxygen food and clean air

are zoonotic meaning they have transmitted from animals to humans as the coronavirus pandemic has shown upsetting the balance of nature by encroaching on wildlife can create the conditions for deadly viruses to spread from animals to humans in the words of the experts the more biodiverse an ecosystem is the more difficult it is for one pathogen to spread rapidly or dominate whereas biodiversity loss provides opportunity for pathogens to pass between animals and people it is now up to us to protect our environment become more sustainable and enter a new normal world environment day how you
