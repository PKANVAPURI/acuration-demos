shortage of public ev charging points in the uk regions in southwest england have one charger per 1148 cars and the east midlands yorkshire and the humber are on similar figures we believe everyone should have access to the necessary means to live sustainably  and nothing should stand in the way of owning an ev choosing an ev charger there are a few fundamental steps to take before you can choose the right ev charger the first thing to consider is what type of ev you have or what type of ev you are considering buying type of electric vehicle the type of vehicle you have will determine how much power your ev charger will need to provide for example plugin hybrid electric vehicles have smaller batteries than traditional evs as they dont run on electricity alone electric vehicles have a range of battery sizes and their capacity is measured in kilowatthours kwh the difference in battery capacity can range from 176 kwh in the smart eq fortwo to a huge 100 kwh in the tesla model x and s to work out what you need we recommend researching the charging capacity of various chargers the energy source used to charge your electric vehicle youll also have to consider what energy source youll be using to charge your ev if you have a microgeneration system such as solar pv panels or a wind turbine youll need an ev charger that is compatible with that power source if youll be charging your ev from the grid youll want to look into energy tariffs that accommodate ev charging  to prevent a significant increase in your utility bills many electricity providers have begun to incentivise ev charging by tailoring tariffs specifically to overnight charging what electric car charger home installation options are there there are two main types of ev charging station fast charging for homes and rapid charging for public chargers most home electric car chargers use ac charging however when rapid charging is required  for instance at motorway service stations  dc charging is typically used as it is quicker theres a vast range of public car charging points throughout the uk  to find the one nearest to you head to the zapmap website we are seeing a rapid increase in the number of charging stations at uk workplaces  particularly from companies that have electric fleets charging at work is becoming an increasingly popular facility  and many businesses are utilising the governments workplace charging scheme wcs which is a voucherbased option that provides financial incentives for installing ev chargers electric car charger home installation uk theres a variety of home ev charging solutions to explore most ev chargers work with all vehicles  the only difference between them is their specifications for example some ev chargers have smart tariff integration and solar charging capabilities while others do not am i eligible for electric car charger home installation probably the good news is that really anyone can get a home charging point for their car installed you dont need to be subject to any specific criteria it is more from a physical standpoint where there might be limitations for example no dedicated parking but if you fit the following criteria then youre good to go dedicated offstreet parking either on your drive or your own parking bay wifi connection at your property permission from your landlord if you rent your property level 1 chargers depending on the level of your home charging system what you need to install will depend on how many volts the charger needs lower voltage level 1 chargers dont require any special installation but they charge at a significantly lower speed level 1 chargers typically provide around 4 miles of range per hour  compared to the standard 24mile range of standard level 2 chargers level 2 chargers level 2 chargers require 240 volts of electricity to operate and need a special installation process similar to that of installing an oven or other highvoltage appliance level 2 chargers require a certified installer although some ev chargers such as the zappi boast safety features that remove the need to install an earth rod earth rods earth rods provide protection from potentially fatal shocks in the event of an electrical fault by diverting current that could escape from a device to a metal conductor official wiring regulations state that in nearly all circumstances ev charger installers will have to install 3ft earth rods to prevent this from happening providing earth rods  and making sure they are safely deep enough in the ground  is timeconsuming and can be difficult in stony surfaces it also pushes up the cost of installation is there any funding available for electric car charger home installation there are different ways of getting a charger installed at home having an ozev approved charger is the most important criteria if you wish to claim the 350 olev grant this grant is given by the government office for low emissions vehicles to cover installation costs and to ensure motorists get a reliable oozev approved charge point installer please note the ozev grant is now only available to landlords tenants and homeowners in flats effective from 1 april 2022 before you have your charger fitted you need to submit an application to the dno district network operator the company responsible for providing electricity to your property this request will state what type of charge youre installing and how powerful it is the dno application is something your installer can do for you but if you want to install your ev charger yourself you need to follow these steps and information we advise that you check the electrical infrastructure of your home before installing an ev charger the typical home works at a specification of roughly 60 amps  and you run the risk of blowing fuses and causing electrical problems if you reach the maximum amount of energy your street or board can manage zappis builtin safety features monitor

the most popular smart ev chargers in the uk vary in price  ranging anywhere from 550  3000 including installation this mainly depends on the technology and specifications of the individual charger zappi is at the lower end of the price spectrum  yet its capabilities are in keeping with the higher end of the price range it not only has the smart capabilities of three charging modes  its also engineered to be as sustainable as possible how do i maintain my electric car charger ev charging points typically dont require much maintenance and any reputable ev charger will come with a 3year warranty there are however ways you can take care of your ev charger to make sure it lasts as long as possible how do i make the most out of my electric car charger many ev chargers come with a huge range of capabilities  going beyond simply charging the ev to make the most out of your ev charger you should find a mode and rate of charge that best suits your needs for example the zappi has three different types of charging mode fast mode this is exactly as it sounds in this mode zappi will charge your vehicle at the maximum power as quickly as possible this mode will utilise any surplus energy available and top up to maximum power from the grid until the vehicle is fully charged eco on eco mode zappi becomes an intelligent device that adjusts its charge rate to minimise using electricity from the national grid with over 14kw surplus zappi will charge just like in eco mode however if the surplus drops below the minimum charge rate of 14kw zappi will pull from the grid to achieve the 14kw and remain charging instead of pausing the charge eco the most economical charging mode this is the complete opposite to fast mode in eco zappi will charge on 100 green energy from your surplus pv with absolutely zero grid power specifically designed to work alongside solar pv panels and wind turbines zappi can automatically start charging your ev with any surplus power
