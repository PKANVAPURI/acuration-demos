about our story green partnerships contact 0 the renewable energy definition you need to know home  guides  jargon buster the renewable energy definition you need to know when something evolves as quickly as renewable energy it can be tricky to keep up with the latest definitions and jargon with new technologies released and entering our homes on a regular basis its easy to get bogged down in the terminology however at myenergi we feel that an opportunity has arisen for us to go back to basics on the principles that define us what is the renewable energy definition renewable energy is often described as clean energy or green energy these terms all mean the same thing the renewable energy definition as indicated by the dictionary is energy from a source that is not depleted when used such as wind or solar power it is essentially energy that can be harnessed and used which comes from natural sources or processes that are constantly replenished and in theory will never die out part of our company mission is to inspire and educate as many people as possible about the role each of us can play in helping to save the planet a huge part of that is educating everyone on the fundamentals of what we do how we do it and most importantly why we do it so without further delay  here is our myenergi glossary of all the renewable energy definitions and myenergi terms that you may come across and what they really mean climate change definitions any significant change in temperature precipitation wind and weather  different from the norm  is known as climate change it is one of the biggest crises humanity is facing and covers more than global warming as it refers to all types of changes happening to our planet here are some of the keywords and phrases associated with this phenomenon global warming commonly associated with climate change global warming describes the increase in the overall temperature of the earths atmosphere global warming is thought to be caused by the greenhouse effect  which in turn is caused by increasing levels of carbon dioxide cfcs and other pollutants in the atmosphere carbon footprint a term used to describe the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere as a result of the actions of an individual organisation or community chlorofluorocarbons cfcs chlorofluorocarbons are a group of chemicals that are made up of chlorine fluorine carbon and hydrogen it was discovered in the 1970s that they were causing a chemical reaction that was destroying the ozone layer and contributing heavily to global warming they were found in fridges and spray cans and were commonly used until the early 2000s until they were banned completely greenhouse effect the greenhouse effect refers to the trapping of the suns heat in our atmosphere it happens when the suns rays reach the earths atmosphere and are unable to be reflected back out again this happens because the rays are absorbed and reemitted by greenhouse gases greenhouse gases greenhouse gases are any gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect by absorbing the suns radiation carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs are the two most common greenhouse gases fossil fuels fossil fuels were formed from the remains of dead organisms over millions of years they are nonrenewable finite resources like crude oil coal and gas  so when they are used up they cant be replaced the ozone layer the ozone layer is part of the earths atmosphere that forms a barrier over the planet it helps keep out harmful radiation from the sun that contributes towards global warming renewable energy definitions renewable energy is any sustainable energy that comes from natural resources like geothermal heat sun wind and water renewable energy also includes biomass hydroelectricity solar electricity and heat geothermal energy wave wind and tidal power biomass biomass can be defined as any organic matter that is available on a renewable basis this includes organic waste from industrial sources plants or animals biomass is burned to release energy by either providing heat or steam that spins turbines geothermal energy geothermal energy is defined as heat derived from within the subsurface of the earth which carries geothermal energy to the surface by water or steam a geothermal power plant works by using the heat from steam or hot water reservoirs underground to drive an electrical generator hydropower hydropower refers to energy that is converted to electricity through flowing water its usually generated through the motion of flowing water turning turbines that spin a generator to generate electricity solar power solar power is energy that derives from the sun it can be harnessed in several ways including through photovoltaic pv and concentrated solar power systems csp these systems work by absorbing the energy from the sun that shines on the panels which creates electricity tidal power tidal power is energy that is produced from the tides of the sea by making use of the difference between lower and higher tides tidal power captures the energy from moving water by using a turbine to generate electricity wave power wave power is created by harnessing the kinetic energy made from the waves of the sea similarly to how tidal power works the individual waves from the sea turn a turbine attached to a generator that generates electricity wind power wind power harnesses the power of the wind by using the kinetic energy made by the wind moving wind turbines to generate electricity wind turbines are used to harness winds kinetic energy and turn it into mechanical power and can vary in size depending on whether they are onshore or offshore renewable energy technology jargon smart meter  a smart meter records the consumption of electricity at short intervals and provides realtime data about how much electricity your home is using and how much it costs it can also control electricity usage remotely low carbon energy  the term low carbon energy refers to any technology that minimises the amount of carbon dioxide or greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere low carbon energy tech can be any renewable energy source and can also include nuclear power solar power diverter  a solar power diverter is a way of storing solar electricity these devices are growing in popularity as they can save you a lot of money how by preventing electricity produced by solar panels being automatically exported back to the national grid and storing it instead watt w  a watt is how we measure how much power or energy is used by a circuit and it is calculated by multiplying the voltage times the current a television can use anywhere between 80 to 400 watts an hour and a lightbulb uses around 60 kilowatt hour kwh  commonly seen on electricity bills a kilowatt hour is the term used to measure electricity usage it is equivalent to a power usage of one thousand watts for one hour electric vehicle ev  an electric vehicle is a vehicle that runs solely on electricity and uses one or more electric motors for movement electric vehicles emit less greenhouse gases and air pollutants than a petrol or diesel car and dont use finite fossil fuels photovoltaic pv  photovoltaic refers to the technology used to directly convert light from the sun into electricity hybrid vehicle  a hybrid vehicle is a combination of an electric and a petrol  diesel car engine in the same vehicle they are used as a more renewable alternative to petrol and diesel cars as they reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using less fuel and emitting less polluting chemicals and waste battery electric vehicles bev  a battery electric vehicle commonly known as a bev is an electric vehicle that is only powered by a battery they dont have a petrol or diesel engine and are 100 electric plugin hybrid electric vehicle phev  a plugin hybrid electric vehicle is a vehicle that has a combination of an electric battery and a petrol or diesel engine the difference between a phev and a hybrid vehicle is that a phev can be recharged by plugging the car in to charge the batteries phevs tend to have a greater electric range than conventional hybrids  which means that they can travel further on electric power alone before the petrol  diesel engine starts up to help myenergi technology zappi our smart electric vehicle charger zappi uses selfgenerated energy from solar or wind sources like pv or wind turbines to charge your electric vehicle it can also be used with electricity from the grid to start charging at the most costefficient times which it does automatically eddi eddi is a solar power diverter for free water and space heating that uses excess energy from your solar panels or wind turbine to store and then use harvi our
