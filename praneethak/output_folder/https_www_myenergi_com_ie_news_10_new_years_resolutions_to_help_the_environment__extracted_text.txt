new years resolutions to help the environment home  renewable energy  10 new years resolutions to help the environment with 2020 just around the corner people are beginning to think of their new years resolutions for the next 12 months a new year presents the ideal opportunity to set goals and make positive changes in your life it is our mission to make such changes to our planet with the help of renewable energy and sustainability there has never been as much focus on saving our planet from the doom and gloom of global warming and climate change than now this means that 2020 is the perfect time to create new years resolutions centred around reducing your carbon footprint and living a greener life 1 make your bathroom plasticfree the first thing we must all stop doing is treating bathroom waste as if its exempt from the recycling process plastic shampoo bottles are more likely to end up in the general waste bin because a lot of people neglect to separate out their bathroom rubbish here are a few ways in which you can increase sustainability in your bathroom use environmentally friendly cleaning products brands such as method are nontoxic and contain as few chemicals as possible they do a great job and have the benefit of smelling really nice buy biodegradable cotton buds and toothbrushes cotton buds tend to get flushed down the toilet find their way to the ocean and do a huge amount of damage to the marine life that ingests them wooden toothbrushes are also available use bar soap rather than heavily packaged liquid soap ensure it doesnt contain palm oil you can also get plasticfree shampoo bars buy shampoos shower gels etc in bulk this reduces the overall amount of packaging especially if you buy refillable products from companies such as faith in nature which has refill stations across the country its easy to find recycled toilet paper but it generally comes in plastic packaging toilet rolls from who gives a crap are packaged in an environmentally friendly way and delivered to your door and they donate 50 of their profits to help build toilets for people in need 2 eat with the seasons eating foods that arent in season inevitably means buying products that have been transported a significant distance for your enjoyment it wouldnt be easy to give up everything that has been imported but the more locally produced seasonal goods we consume the better eating the seasons mean we reduce the energy and associated co2 emissions required to get food to our table locally produced seasonal foods are fresher and therefore taste better and provide higher levels of vitamins and minerals imported vegetables have often been treated with chemicals or gasses postharvest to extend their shelflife seasonal food is also generally less expensive than imported food that is out of season in the uk 3 carry your own water bottle you may think that as long as you recycle your water bottles youre not doing any harm however recycling costs money and is a complicated process often meaning than not all of the bottle is recycled anyway its a far better idea to carry your own bottle and refill it when its empty there are lots of different types to choose from some are very light some have a lovely design some keep drinks cool and you can add fruit to some for a little bit of flavour 4 use public transport walk or cycle it doesnt always seem especially convenient to take public transport walk or cycle however there are so many benefits and we recommend giving it some serious thought less vehicles on the road reduces emissions that harm the environment fewer emissions result in healthier air for peoples lungs  especially in cities and for those at exhaust level  iechildren walking and cycling are great exercise it could be much cheaper for you you could even compromise by using a park and bike system of course some areas are not well served with public transport and some rail season tickets are extremely expensive if you rely on a car to get to your place of work offer to share with a colleague  if you work in a big city you may get there more quickly than everybody else thanks to carsharing lanes 5 cut down on food waste heres a couple of statistics that arent very easy to digest a third of food produced in the world every year is lost or wasted thats approximately 13 billion tonnes per capita waste by consumers is over 10 times higher per year in europe and north america than in subsaharan africa south and southeastern asia consumers arent responsible for all of this  some is destroyed at the farm gate because it might not be the correct quality  but theres still a lot we can do to reduce this obscene amount of waste such as support retailers offering imperfect fruit and vegetables at lower prices such as morrisons wonky range steer clear of 2 for 1 and bogof deals in supermarkets unless you are absolutely sure the items are something you will definitely consume or something you can freeze for a later date learn to make soups stews and smoothies to use up fruit and vegetables that are past their best the benefit of doing this ensures youll get your 5aday remember that best before dates are just that  best before if it looks tastes and smells fine then it will be fine the important date to take notice of is the use by date these are applied to products that become unsafe to eat quite quickly even though they may look fine 6 use renewable energy renewable energy has never been more accessible install rooftop solar panels or even a small wind turbine depending on where you live and local restrictions replace your standard boiler with a biomass boiler if you live near a stream or river you could even look into hydro power choose a green energy supplier prices may not be quite as competitive as a standard supplier but they are beginning to come down more info on this can be found here what are the 5 types of renewable energy top 5 reasons to use renewable energy who supplies green energy in the uk 7 switch off appliances when not in use did you know that electricity still runs inside an appliance while its switched off if its left plugged into a live wall socket according to the energy saving trust we could also save ourselves around 80 per year on our electricity bills if we didnt leave items on standby the main culprit for wasting energy in our homes whilst on standby is the television which is on standby for an average of 11 hours per day costing 238million annually wow after that computers tablets mobile phones settop boxes and consoles waste the most energy on standby as well as saving money and energy its worth remembering to switch off a computer as its lifetime is dependant on how much its in use just dont unplug your sky box if its set to series link make sure you and the rest of your family dont leave lights blazing in rooms youre not even in and install some led light bulbs which not only use less electricity but last longer reducing the need to recycle them 8 have your food shop delivered or walk to the shop most supermarkets offer a delivery service these days its a great option not only does it save you time and money because theres less browsing but one van delivering to 10 houses is much more environmentally friendly than 10 cars driving to a supermarket in april 2019 sainsburys began making deliveries in some electric vans its highly likely others will follow walking to the shops is obviously a great idea if you can the exercise and fresh air is good for you and chances are youll buy less if you have to carry it home therefore less waste waitrose is beginning to offer customers the chance to refill reusable containers in some of its stores in a new initiative  waitrose unpacked zero waste shops are beginning to crop up all over the country the advantage of these is threefold if not more you buy only as much of a product as you need therefore reducing waste there is no singleuse packaging and no plastic carrier bags the products stocked tend to be conscientiously sourced  fairtrade items nontoxic cleaning products nut butters ground in store etc 9 consider an electric vehicle electric cars are quiet clean relaxing to drive and inexpensive to run more and more manufacturers are introducing electric vehicles and although they may be more expensive now prices will come down and you will save on fuel and road tax factor in zappi our innovative sustainable renewable energy car charger and youll be seriously reducing your carbon footprint and bills in no time learn more uks top 6 electric vehicles 10 fly less there are plenty of ways to travel that dont involve flying and plenty of places to visit that dont require an aeroplane to get you there why not try and take a year off flying and visit some of the incredible sights the uk has to offer or take a boat or train to the continent if you have to fly and many people do for work family occasions etc then you could look into carbon offsetting the idea is that the amount of co2 generated by your particular trip is reduced somewhere else this may be via a forestry project reducing trees cut down or planting new ones or by reducing fossil fuels by investing in renewable energy elsewhere carbonoffsetting is a little controversial and seemingly loved by celebrities some carbon offsetting companies appear to be in the business to make a profit rather than helping the planet and the idea that you can pay to ease the guilt rather than change your habitslifestyle are factors that need to be overcome before it will be perceived as a universally viable idea but the intention is there and every little helps 2020 is your year to shine make 2020 the year you give serious consideration to helping the environment we all share and lets band together to leave our home in the best condition possible for the next generation share story related news view all news about myenergi what does rising electricity costs mean for charging
