comply with sae j1772 en62196 and en61851 plugin electric vehicle standards zappi works like any regular charging point but has special eco charging modes which will benefit homeowners with gridtied microgeneration systems like wind or solar generation two special eco charging modes automatically adjust charging current in response to onsite generation and household power consumption in fast charge mode zappi operates like an ordinary ev charging a grid current sensor supplied simply clips around the incoming supply cable this sensor is used to monitor excess power and when using the special eco charge modes zappi automatically adjusts the charge rate in response to available surplus eddi eddi is an energy management system for use with gridtied pv or wind turbine systems excess energy from the microgeneration system is used to heat water or rooms rather than exporting it to the grid a grid current sensor supplied simply clips around the incoming supply cable this sensor is used to monitor excess power and eddi automatically adjusts the voltage to the heater load thereby consuming the surplus power a selfpowered wireless sensor harvi is available separately an internal expansion interface provides a means to install a relay  sensor board to enable various functions such as auto switching from daytime and nighttime supply heat pump interfacing for legionella control and temperature sensing eddi utilises myenergis proprietary varisinetm technology to ensure compliance with worldwide power grid standards harvi harvi is a clever device that enables the zappi and eddi products to be installed without using a wired current transformer ct instead the ct that reads grid generation or battery etc can be connected to harvi no power source is needed for harvi the ct harvests energy from the cable that it monitors until it can transmit the measurement signal to the zappi or eddi this means batteries or electrical wiring are eliminated note it is not currently g100 compliant to connect the grid ct to a harvi in conjunction with a zappi install installer training timetable join us at 930am for a cuppa and a chat introduction to myenergi  product lineup break for
