number of secondhand cars is increasing is an electric family car even possible as a parent a family with young children will often still have to take you everywhere by car think of the soccer matches outside their home town days out to an amusement park or a family vacation to a campsite in france in a family a car is often indispensable because of the many trips you make as a parent many wonder if an electric family car is so convenient after all you can t drive as far with a full battery as you can with a tank of gasoline it also takes much longer to charge than a tank of gas especially with small children who are not keen on standing still for three quarters of an hour at a charging station this is a challenge still even as a family with the necessary preparations you can get on the road well with a family electric car what does an electric family car have to meet ideally a family electric car should have a large range and enough legroom to provide a nice seat for everyone in addition a good trunk is also handy to store all the sports gear and suitcases before you head out with your family you probably already have your hands full at home to get everyone ready on time therefore it is not pleasant if you also have to charge your car first afterwards having your own ev charger that you can use at home is therefore ideal with zappi you can easily ensure that your car is ready for you the morning before your departure with a full battery do you have solar panels then you can take full advantage of those to charge your car as well before you go before you hit the road with your family electric car its a good idea to determine your route in advance see what is the quickest way to your destination and where charging stations can be found should the battery run down unexpectedly it is always helpful to know where you can charge are you going to an amusement park or zoo check the website to see if the park has special parking spaces for family electric cars then while youre visiting the park with your family you can charge your car right away for the return trip extra tip bring plenty of entertainment for the road especially for young children waiting until an electric car is fully charged takes a very long time therefore bring a puzzle book or reading book or let them watch their favorite movie on a tablet dont forget their favorite cuddly toy it can keep them company while waiting share story related news see all articles more about myenergi myenergi receives a 30 million investment from energy impact partners to promote growth and
