blog  what is cop26 cop26 is the word on everyones lips but what is it and why has it got the whole world talking for more than a quarter of a century the united nations un have been bringing together most of the earths countries for global climate summits also known as conference of the parties cops the annual event brings together almost twohundred world leaders to discuss the worlds commitment to climate change this year marks the twentysixth year and therefore giving it the name cop26 when and where is it historically members of cop have offered to host the event and this year the uk are hosting the event alongside our partner italy right here in glasgow the summit will take place at the scottish event campus sec from sunday 31 october to friday 12 november 2021 scottish event campus sec why is this years conference so important since the very first cop summit took place in 1995 the subject of climate change has become a growing concern from being an issue of fairly low importance to a global emergency a crucial moment for this change happened at cop21 in 2015 when the paris agreement was formed the paris agreement was the first ever legally binding commitment to mitigate global warming the agreement meant that every single country irrespective of their size agreed to reducing carbon emissions to drop the global temperature increase to less than 2 degrees celsius  with an aim to try and reduce this even further to less than 15 degrees celsius the agreement also presented a financial commitment to ensure that funds were made available to help deliver the aims set out also as part of the agreement every fiveyears each country is required to update their plans setting out how they intend to reduce their emissions and how much by these are known as nationally determined contributions ndcs the ndcs that were set out in paris unfortunately did not meet the 2 degrees set out in the agreement and the window for achieving the target is closing therefore this cop is crucial as countries must provide stronger plans to be in with a chance of achieving the target what is myenergi doing to support cop26 and the uk in their contribution to climate change at myenergi we recognise that the targets set at cop are important but what is crucial is the action taken to achieve those targets and that is why we are a headline partner of the fully charged stopburningstuff manifesto in 2021s cop26 the manifesto specifically focuses on the solutions to climate change the biggest threat humanity has ever faced and our products are a key part of the solution our products allow users to utilise their surplus green energy ultimately reducing reliance on the grid and providing users with energy independence myenergi zappi ev charger as we move towards the electrification of vehicles providing zero emission transport also brings about the challenge of reducing extra strain on the grid our ecosmart ev charger zappi has the ability to charge through 100 selfgenerated green energy and off grid with many intelligent features the zappi gives users complete control of their electric car charging experience such as the ability to utilise time of use and economy tariffs allowing users to schedule chargers at times when energy tariffs are at their lowest thus encouraging energy consciousness but the electrification is just one step towards decarbonisation the notion towards implementing ecosmart technology in new homes as standard will provide another way in which we can remove the need for burning coal and thus reduce strain on the grid that is why we have created eddi eddi is a microgeneration energy diverter which provides a brain to any solar pv and renewable home set up rather than filtering surplus energy back to the grid eddi allows users to maximise the use of their surplus green energy by diverting it elsewhere within the home with all this new technology integrating them into your current home property set up can seem daunting and costly we have created integrated wireless technologies such as harvi and hub making it very easy for installers by reducing difficult cable routing making for quicker and easier installations this seamless control and monitoring ecosystem between all myenergi smart home products combined with the potential return on investment benefits is totally unique in the marketplace
